Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\nNext comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\nAs full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\nImmediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\nThe second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\nDrive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\nAt this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position."

This is your starting position.\nPull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\nAfter a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nIf you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.\nOn the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.\nThe behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck."

   "description": "The back extension is an exercise used to build lower back strength that also targets the hamstrings and glutes. It is often performed on a 45-degree bench with the feet anchored. Unweighted back extensions are often performed for high reps, such as 15-20 reps or more, but the movement can also be performed with added weight in lower rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set.",
   "benefits": "Builds size and strength in the hamstrings and glutes\nIncreases lower back strength and muscular endurance\nCan be progressed by holding weights or adding band resistance\nEffective posterior chain training without loading the spine, unlike a deadlift or squat",
   "instructions": {
			"en": "Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads.\nAdjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction.\nWith your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.\nStart bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.\nSlowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

   "benefits": "Builds muscular strength and endurance in the hamstrings, glutes, and quads\nWorks core and upper-back strength to maintain a neutral spine\nImproves hip mobility to reach proper depth\nGreat component of a bodyweight circuit workout",
   "instructions": {
			"en": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\nWith your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box.

Never bounce off of a box.\nKeeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head.

   "description": "The barbell front squat is a compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups. With the barbell racked in front of the body on the anterior delts, the front squat emphasizes the quads and glutes, but also upper back and core strength to remain upright. Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.",
   "benefits": "Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings\nBuilds upper-back and core strength to stay upright\nEncourages good mobility in the hips, shoulders, ankles\nMay be more spine-friendly than back squats\nMultiple grip options: rack, crossed arms, \"zombie\" arms, or holding onto straps that are wrapped around the bar",
   "instructions": {
			"en": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\nLift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\nAs you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary (only the arms should move). The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull the bar down using the forearms.\nAfter a second in the contracted position, while squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.

Speed squats are popular in certain powerlifting training methodologies as a way to engrain form and lifting speed that can carry over to max-effort lifts. In this approach, they are usually performed in numerous sets of 3-5 reps with adequate rest in between. Speed squats are also sometimes performed with bands or chains adding extra resistance to the top half of the lift.",

   "instructions": {
			"en": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Note: You should perform these exercises as fast as possible but without breaking perfect form and without involving momentum.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\nGrab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.\nAs you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\nAfter a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions."

Keep your head up at all times. This will be your starting position.\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees.\nRaise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heels of your feet as you extend the hips and knees.\nAt the top of the movement, side step, bringing your feet together on the opposite side of the plate.\nUsing your inside foot, push the weight plate, sliding it across the floor to where you were just standing.\nPlace your inside foot on the weight plate, adopting a wide stance for the next repetition."

The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\nAfter a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nSwitch arms and repeat the movement.\nIf you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help."

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\nLift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.",

It is a competition lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also considered a classic benchmark of overall strength. When performed with the hands outside the knees, it is often called a \"conventional\" deadlift. When the feet are wide and the hands are inside the knees, it is a sumo deadlift.",
   "benefits": "Primarily targets the back, hamstrings, and glutes, but also brings in the lats, traps, and forearms\nBuilds core strength and stability\nCan be beneficial even at light or moderate weights\nSimple to scale for non-powerlifters by raising the bar to where someone can perform it without flexing their lower back\nIf grip is a limitation, it can be performed with a mixed grip or using straps",
