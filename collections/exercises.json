Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\nWith your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\nKeeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\nNext comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\nAs full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\nImmediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\nThe second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\nDrive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\nAt this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position."

These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.\nOn the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.\nThe behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck."

At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\nAs full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, pull yourself under the bar far enough that it can be racked onto the shoulders, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed.\nImmediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position, and complete the repetition by returning the weight to the boxes."

A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\nAlso, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\nBe cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more."

   "description": "The close-grip EZ-bar curl is an exercise targeting the biceps, particularly the long head. The main difference between this exercise and standard EZ-bar curls is that the hands are positioned closer together on the bar. It is thought that this helps build the outer biceps head and the peak. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set.",

The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.\nWhile holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.\nContinue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.\nSlowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\nYou can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.\nYou may also use the wider grip for variety purposes."

Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position.\nUsing your lats, pull your torso up while leaning your head back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion.\nAfter a second hold on the contracted position, slowly lower your body back to the starting position as you breathe in.\nRepeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.\nIf you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a pull-up assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help."

   "description": "The Smith machine back squat is a machine-based exercise targeting the muscles of the lower body. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a full-body or lower-body workout.",

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nPosition your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\nAfter the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\nSimultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\nOnce the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\nCatch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\nStand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\nLower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\nSimultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.\nSquat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.\nStart over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Like most curl variations, these are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",

Make sure that you contract the biceps as you breathe out and make sure that only the forearms move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.\nSlowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position as your breathe in and as you rotate the wrists back to a neutral grip.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\nThere are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc."

At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull.

Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.

Tip: Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the best results from this exercise.\nThe arms should be elevated until they are level with the head.\nFeel the contraction and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.

Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

This is the starting position.\nBegin by moving the barbell back down in a semicircular motion as if you were going to place it on the floor, but instead, stop when the arms are parallel to the floor. Tip: Keep the arms fully extended at all times. The movement should only happen at the shoulder joint. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nNow bring the barbell up while exhaling until you are back at the starting position. Remember to keep full control of the barbell at all times.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\nWhen finished with your set, slowly lower the barbell back down until it is level with your head and release it."

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\nLift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Start with your feet together, arms bent, and elbows at your side.\nAt the same time, jump both feet out to the side, allowing your elbows to swing out slightly. Immediately reverse the motion by jumping back to the starting position and bringing your elbows back into your side.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.",

   "description": "The cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. Since it's done using adjustable pulleys, you can target different parts of your chest by setting the pulleys at different levels. It is common in upper body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout, or a finishing movement at the end. It is often in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.",
   "benefits": "Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction\nAbility to quickly switch weights for dropsets\nAbility to customize cable height to target specific areas of the chest\nStretches the chest mucles under load, which can lead to greater muscle gain",

   "description": "The barbell roll-out is an abdominal exercise that utilizes a barbell in the place of an ab roller. It is best performed with a barbell that has rotating collars, and is considered more difficult than other ab roller variations. Many lifters may not be able to perform a single rep at first, but once they can perform these for reps, they'll be rewarded with a seriously strong core.",
   "benefits": "Works core strength and stability\nEngages all muscle groups of the core\nEncourages coordination, mobility, and lumbar positioning\nUnlike with an ab roller, grip width can be altered based on shoulder comfort",

   "description": "The dumbbell chest fly is a popular exercise that targets the pectoral or chest muscles. It attempts to isolate the chest muscles, stretching and contracting them while limiting involvement of the shoulders. Unlike a press, where the elbows bend and flex, flyes should keep a relatively consistent elbow angle. The motion is sometimes compared to \"hugging a tree.\" Dumbbell flyes are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body focused workout.",

   "description": "The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength. It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.",
   "benefits": "Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings\nRequires back and core strength to maintain torso positioning\nCan be used to improve conditioning and cardiovascular health\nConsidered by many to be \"the king of exercises\"",

   "description": "The band front raise rear fly row combo is a combination of three different shoulder exercises to build and strengthen the anterior, middle deltoids, and posterior portions of the shoulders. It requires a continuous loop band to provide constant, dynamic tension throughout the movement. In addition to the front and rear delts, this exercise works the arms, chest, back, and core, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day.",
   "benefits": "Builds size in the shoulders\nProlonged muscle time under tension\nGreat burnout on shoulder day or time-efficient shoulder pump in any workout\nUses lightweight equipment suitable for at-home workouts",

   "description": "Similar to the cable chest fly, the band chest fly is a single-joint movement that works the pectoral muscles. The fly is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, and the band variation works well as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout or a finishing movement at the end. It is often used in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.",
   "benefits": "Bands provide dynamic tension, increasing at peak contraction\nUses lightweight equipment suitable for at-home workouts\nCan customize fly height to target specific areas of the chest\nStretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain",

   "description": "The band standing concentration curl is a variation of a popular biceps-focused exercise utilizing a band instead of a dumbbell. It allows you to focus on one biceps at a time and really squeeze out intense peak contractions. Band concentration curls are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.",
   "benefits": "Builds stronger and more muscular biceps\nLimits momentum to isolate the biceps and prevent assistance from other muscle groups\nGreat for building a nice peak in the biceps\nBand provides dynamic tension throughout each rep",

It also targets the biceps to a lesser degree. The band row can work well in a variety of rep ranges, requiring a heavier band for muscle-building and strength workouts and a lighter band for weight-loss work and as an accessory movement.",
   "benefits": "The band provides dynamic tension throughout the movement, increasing at peak contraction\nUses lightweight equipment suitable for at-home workouts\nEasy to adjust tension\nCan use a variety of hand placements and grip widths to target different parts of the back",
